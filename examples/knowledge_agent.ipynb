An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\\n\\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\\nThat all men follow.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nI must not think there are\\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\\nThan what he chooses.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nHere’s more news.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\\nGive him much wronged.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nI should have known no less.\\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\\nTo rot itself with motion.\\n\\n Enter a second Messenger.\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER.\\nCaesar, I bring thee word\\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\\nThan could his war resisted.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nAntony,\\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\nSo much as lanked not.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\n’Tis pity of him.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nLet his shames quickly\\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\\nThrives in our idleness.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nTomorrow, Caesar,\\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\\nTo front this present time.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nTill which encounter\\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nFarewell, my lord.

An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\\n\\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\\nThat all men follow.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nI must not think there are\\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\\nThan what he chooses.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nHere’s more news.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\\nGive him much wronged.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nI should have known no less.\\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\\nTo rot itself with motion.\\n\\n Enter a second Messenger.\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER.\\nCaesar, I bring thee word\\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\\nThan could his war resisted.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nAntony,\\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\nSo much as lanked not.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\n’Tis pity of him.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nLet his shames quickly\\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\\nThrives in our idleness.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nTomorrow, Caesar,\\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\\nTo front this present time.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nTill which encounter\\nIt is my business too.

An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\\n\\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\\nThat all men follow.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nI must not think there are\\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\\nThan what he chooses.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nHere’s more news.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\\nGive him much wronged.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nI should have known no less.\\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\\nTo rot itself with motion.\\n\\n Enter a second Messenger.\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER.\\nCaesar, I bring thee word\\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\\nThan could his war resisted.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nAntony,\\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\nSo much as lanked not.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\n’Tis pity of him.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nLet his shames quickly\\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\\nThrives in our idleness.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nTomorrow, Caesar,\\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\\nTo front this present time.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nTill which encounter\\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nFarewell, my lord.

Think on me\\nThat am with Phœbus’ amorous pinches black,\\nAnd wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\\nWhen thou wast here above the ground, I was\\nA morsel for a monarch.

An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\\n\\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\\nThat all men follow.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nI must not think there are\\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\\nThan what he chooses.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nHere’s more news.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\\nGive him much wronged.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nI should have known no less.\\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\\nTo rot itself with motion.\\n\\n Enter a second Messenger.\\n\\nSECOND MESSENGER.\\nCaesar, I bring thee word\\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\\nThan could his war resisted.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nAntony,\\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\nSo much as lanked not.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\n’Tis pity of him.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nLet his shames quickly\\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\\nThrives in our idleness.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nTomorrow, Caesar,\\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\\nTo front this present time.\\n\\nCAESAR.\\nTill which encounter\\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\\n\\nLEPIDUS.\\nFarewell, my lord.

I take no pleasure\\nIn aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee\\nThat, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts\\nMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?\\n\\nMARDIAN.\\nYes, gracious madam.\\n\\nCLEOPATRA.\\nIndeed?\\n\\nMARDIAN.\\nNot in deed, madam, for I can do nothing\\nBut what indeed is honest to be done.\\nYet have I fierce affections, and think\\nWhat Venus did with Mars.\\n\\nCLEOPATRA.\\nO, Charmian,\\nWhere think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?\\nOr does he walk? Or is he on his horse?\\nO happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\\nDo bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?\\nThe demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\\nAnd burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,\\nOr murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”\\nFor so he calls me. Now I feed myself\\nWith most delicious poison. Think on me\\nThat am with Phœbus’ amorous pinches black,\\nAnd wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\\nWhen thou wast here above the ground, I was\\nA morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey\\nWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;\\nThere would he anchor his aspect, and die\\nWith looking on his life.\\n\\n Enter Alexas.\\n\\nALEXAS.\\nSovereign of Egypt, hail!\\n\\nCLEOPATRA.\\nHow much unlike art thou Mark Antony!\\nYet, coming from him, that great medicine hath\\nWith his tinct gilded thee.\\nHow goes it with my brave Mark Antony?\\n\\nALEXAS.\\nLast thing he did, dear queen,\\nHe kissed—the last of many doubled kisses—\\nThis orient pearl.

All the east,\\nSay thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded\\nAnd soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,\\nWho neighed so high that what I would have spoke\\nWas beastly dumbed by him.\\n\\nCLEOPATRA.\\nWhat, was he sad or merry?\\n\\nALEXAS.\\nLike to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes\\nOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.\\n\\nCLEOPATRA.\\nO well-divided disposition!—Note him,\\nNote him, good Charmian, ’tis the man; but note him:\\nHe was not sad, for he would s...'}\n",

From Alexandria\\\\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\\\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\\\\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\\\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\\\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\\\\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\\\\nThat all men follow.\\\\n\\\\nLEPIDUS.\\\\nI must not think there are\\\\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\\\\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\\\\nMore fiery by night\\u2019s blackness; hereditary\\\\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\\\\nThan what he chooses.\\\\n\\\\nCAESAR.\\\\nYou are too indulgent.

Thou didst drink\\\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\\\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\\\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\\\\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\\\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\\\\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\\\\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this\\u2014\\\\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now\\u2014\\\\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\\\nSo much as lanked not.\\\\n\\\\nLEPIDUS.\\\\n\\u2019Tis pity of him.\\\\n\\\\nCAESAR.\\\\nLet his shames quickly\\\\nDrive him to Rome. \\u2019Tis time we twain\\\\nDid show ourselves i\\u2019 th\\u2019 field, and to that end\\\\nAssemble we immediate council.

Thou didst drink\\\\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\\\nWhich beasts would cough at.
